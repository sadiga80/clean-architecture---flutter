An app to demonstrate clean architecture.

## Getting Started

Clean architecture is a category of software design pattern for software architecture that follows the concepts of clean code and implements SOLID principles.

Itâ€™s essentially a collection of best practice design principles that help you keep business logic, or domain logic, together and minimize the dependencies within the system. If followed, clean architecture lets software architects with decoupling components so they become isolated enough to be durable and easily changed without remaking the system.
